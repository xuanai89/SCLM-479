# Fine Scandinavia: Launching a New Kitchenware & Home-Appliance Line

## About This Project

This project presents a comprehensive, integrated supply chain blueprint for **Fine Scandinavia Co., Ltd.** to support the strategic launch of a new premium Nordic kitchenware and home-appliance line.

The entire strategy is architected for a new manufacturing facility in **Dat Cuoc, Binh Duong, Vietnam**, with a primary focus on exporting to the **European market**. The plan provides a data-driven framework to build an agile, resilient, and sustainable value chain capable of scaling to 3 million units per year by 2030.

## Key Areas of Analysis

The project provides a detailed analysis and strategic plan for the following core supply chain functions:

**Demand Planning:** A 5-year market forecast (2026-2030) for five new product categories, complete with seasonal decomposition to drive production.

**Supply Planning:** A detailed Master Production Schedule (MPS) designed to meet the demand forecast, optimize factory capacity (2-shift vs. 3-shift), and manage Â±20% demand volatility.

**Purchasing:** In-depth Bills of Materials (BOMs) for all new products, a strategic sourcing plan using Kraljic and Supplier Preferencing matrices, and a long-term procurement strategy.

**Logistics Network Design:** A dual-pronged logistics model featuring:

Inbound: A hybrid model using intermodal rail (from Northern VN) and direct transport (from Southern VN) to the Dat Cuoc plant.
    
Outbound: A primary export channel (to Cat Lai/Cai Mep ports) and an agile Make-to-Order (MTO) domestic fulfillment model.
    
**Quality Management Plan:** A comprehensive QMP to ensure all products meet stringent EU compliance standards (e.g., EC 1935/2004, RoHS, LVD) and premium brand expectations.

**Sustainability & EPR:** A "do-now" roadmap for achieving key sustainability goals (e.g., 30% renewable energy) and ensuring full compliance with Vietnam's Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) regulations.

**Technology Strategy:** Functional specifications for an integrated information system (ERP, CRM, WMS, TMS) to act as the digital nervous system for the entire operation.
